            Direct hiring involves employers sourcing their own maids directly from their home countries.\
             These maids are typically discovered through the employerâ€™s personal connections, such as recommendations from family, friends,\
              or former maids who have returned to their home countries. Although employers are able to interview and select a maid who fits their household requirements on their own,\
               the necessary paperwork required, both foreign and in Singapore may pose a challenge for employers. EP One Manpower can help to handle all required end-to-end documentation.
